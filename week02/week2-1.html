        Some thoughts from "Ways of Seeing" by John Berger</h2>
    <p>
            The meaning of images that everyone understands is different, 
        the meaning of image is easy to be tampered with, 
        image is easy to be copied.Images are still. It's like a corridor, 
        connecting the monent when the image expresses itself 
        with the moment when the viwer is watching. As a result,
        half of the interpretation of the image depends on the moment the audience looks at it.

    <p> 
        This is a pciture I took from Whitney Museum. My friend and I have different understanding of it.
        He feels the skull symbolize god or demon, something above everthing. 
        My understanding is that death and life is a cycle which are closely related. 
        Death can breed alive creatures, and those creatures will die one day and become others nutrient.
